# Road Safety Awareness Project

This repository contains code and resources for a project focused on raising awareness about road safety, particularly among students. The project aims to analyze and visualize data related to road safety practices, attitudes, and knowledge, with the goal of informing interventions and policies to improve road safety.

## Features

- Data collection from student surveys
- Data preprocessing including cleaning and transformation
- Exploratory data analysis to uncover insights
- Visualization of road safety data using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Altair
- Statistical analysis including correlation matrices and regression models
- Interactive visualizations for better understanding
- Recommendations based on analysis findings

## Usage

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/road-safety-awareness.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd road-safety-awareness`
3. Explore the Jupyter Notebooks in the `notebooks` directory to understand the project workflow and analysis.
4. Run the code cells in the notebooks to execute the analysis steps and visualize the data.
5. Customize and extend the code to suit your needs.

## Data Sources

- The project uses simulated data for demonstration purposes. Real-world data from surveys or official road safety databases can be substituted for actual analysis.
